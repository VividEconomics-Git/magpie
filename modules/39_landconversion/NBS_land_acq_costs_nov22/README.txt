If you come across this branch, you have wandered into the realm of updated MAGPIE NBS costs!

You will see three of each file, with a different suffix:
1) .gms; 
2) ORIG_costs.gms; 
3) updated_costs.gms

1) is what MAGPIE will read in. Here, we have set 1) = 3) (as in, we updated the script to read in the new costs)
2) is an original version, which you can revert to if the custom costs aren't working
3) is the updated script which accomodates new or altered input files which contain the new cost estimates
